README

This is an Android App to display the recent Earthquakes from the data taken from the USGS Earthquake site.

We used JSON Parsing to parse the data from the USGS site and displayed the the earthquakes with the location, magnitude and time. Also, an added feature was added to make the different earthquakes clickable which when clicked goes to the USGS page of the specific earthquake.
